# Law of the Instrument (Golden Hammer)

**Description:**  
The Law of the Instrument, often summarized as "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail," warns against over-relying on familiar tools or methods. This principle, introduced by Abraham Maslow in 1966, emphasizes the importance of selecting the right tool or approach based on the specific problem, rather than defaulting to what is most familiar.

**Implications in Software Engineering:**  
- Encourages developers to evaluate the suitability of technologies, frameworks, or methodologies before applying them to a problem.
- Helps avoid technical debt by promoting diversity in toolsets and solutions.
- Supports innovation by challenging the status quo and exploring alternatives.

**Example:**  
A developer who only knows one programming language might attempt to use it for every project, even when a different language would be more appropriate, such as using a web framework for a data-heavy batch processing job.
