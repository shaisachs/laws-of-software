# Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution

**Description:**  
Lehman's Laws describe how long-lived software systems evolve. The core insight: 
Software must change continuously, and without disciplined maintenance, complexity naturally increases.

Lehman's Laws wrap eight laws regarding 'embedded' programs (E-Type).

**Implications in Software Engineering:**  
- Necessitates ongoing refactoring and architectural stewardship.  
- Predicts that stability and quality decline unless active measures counter entropy.  
- Supports incremental and evolutionary development approaches.

**Example:**  
A monolithic enterprise system that grows over years becomes harder to modify
unless teams routinely restructure modules and manage dependencies.
