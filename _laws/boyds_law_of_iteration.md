# Boyd's Law of Iteration

**Description:**  
Boyd's Law of Iteration, named after military strategist John Boyd, suggests that faster iterations beat slower ones in competitive environments. It emphasizes continuous feedback loops and rapid development to outpace competitors.

**Implications in Software Engineering:**  
- Encourages agile methodologies that promote short development cycles and quick feedback.
- Improves adaptability to changing requirements and user needs.

**Example:**  
Agile sprints are an example of rapid iteration, allowing teams to deliver incremental updates and adjust based on user feedback.

**Reference:**  
[John Boyd's OODA Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)#OODA_loop) (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) concept in strategic thinking.
