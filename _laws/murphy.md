# Murphy's Law

**Description:**  
Murphy's Law, attributed to engineer Edward A. Murphy Jr. around 1949, states that "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." It serves as a reminder to expect the unexpected and account for potential failures, particularly in complex systems like software engineering.

**Implications in Software Engineering:**  
- Highlights the importance of robust testing, error handling, and contingency planning.
- Encourages defensive programming techniques to anticipate and mitigate possible issues.
- Underlines the need for thorough reviews and risk assessments, as even minor oversights can lead to significant problems.

**Example:**  
A classic manifestation of Murphyâ€™s Law in software development is when a seemingly minor change in the codebase introduces unexpected bugs in unrelated parts of the system.
