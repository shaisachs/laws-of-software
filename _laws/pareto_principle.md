# Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

**Description:**  
The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 Rule, was first observed by economist Vilfredo Pareto in 1896. It states that 80% of the results or effects in many systems come from 20% of the causes or inputs. In software development, this principle often manifests in code, where a small portion of the system's code provides the majority of its functionality or performance impact.

**Implications in Software Engineering:**  
- Helps developers focus on the 20% of features or code that deliver the most value to users.
- Guides optimization efforts by prioritizing the most impactful areas, such as performance bottlenecks or critical bug fixes.
- Encourages a balanced approach to feature development and maintenance.

**Example:**  
In many software systems, 80% of user complaints may stem from just 20% of the applicationâ€™s codebase. By identifying and addressing this critical 20%, significant improvements can be made efficiently.
